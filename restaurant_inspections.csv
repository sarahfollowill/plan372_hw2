The school administration has purchased new roof air conditioning units for the gym and had the installation of these units scheduled for January 17 2022. The installation had to be rescheduled due to winter storm conditions on that date. Management has the installation rescheduled for the next teacher work day in February 2022. This is being done since cranes are being brought on campus on the date of install to lift the air conditioning units on the roof. This work needs to be completed when students are not present on campus. A follow up visit will be conducted by this department after installation is completed to verify that the gym air conditioning system is functional. Repair nonfunctional ceiling light fixtures in classroom #4. Replace changing pad with torn covering on diapering station in the shared bathroom in preschool building #1. Diaper changing pads must have intact water proof surfaces to allow for proper cleaning and disinfection between student uses.
